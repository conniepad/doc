I’m excited to announce a big upgrade to tables in the app! With this new feature, organizing your data is now easier (and more fun) than ever. You can simply drag and drop columns and rows to reorder them however you like—perfect for keeping your info in exactly the right place.

Adding new rows and columns is just as simple. Whether you're expanding your list or reworking a layout, you can quickly insert what you need with a click. And for those moments when you need more flexibility, you can merge cells to create custom layouts that work for your content.

But that’s not all—you can also style individual cells with custom background colors! This makes it easy to visually highlight important sections or organize your data in a way that stands out.

Try it out and make your tables work exactly the way you want. I can’t wait to hear what you think!
