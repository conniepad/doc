I’m excited to introduce a feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your notes — automatic save history! Now, your notes will be captured a snapshot every 5 minutes, so if you accidentally make changes or need to go back to a previous version, you’re covered.

This feature gives you the peace of mind that your notes are always safe. And as a bonus, it acts as a backup in case iCloud ever fails, ensuring you never lose important information.

Your notes are in good hands—safe, secure, and always recoverable!
