I’m happy to introduce a handy new feature—now you can easily convert your notes to Markdown format! This makes it super convenient if you want to share your notes with other apps, or use them in automations and shortcuts.

With just a few clicks, your notes are transformed into a clean Markdown file, ready for you to send, edit, or integrate wherever you need. Whether you’re working with other note-taking apps or setting up a workflow, this feature helps you move your content smoothly across platforms.

Give it a try and see how Markdown export makes your notes even more versatile!
