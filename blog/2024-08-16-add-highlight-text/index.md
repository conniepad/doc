We’ve just added a feature that I think you’re going to love—text highlighting! Now, you can bring even more personality and organization to your notes by adding a splash of color to important sections.

Whether you’re jotting down key ideas, to-do lists, or important reminders, highlighting makes it easier to focus on what really matters. Simply select your text, choose your favorite highlight color, and voilà—your notes are instantly more readable and organized.

This feature fits right in with our mission to make note-taking effortless and enjoyable. So go ahead, give it a try and brighten up your notes! As always, I’d love to hear what you think—your feedback helps make the app even better.

Happy highlighting!
