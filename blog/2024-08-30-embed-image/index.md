I’m thrilled to announce that adding images to your notes just got a whole lot easier! You can now effortlessly embed multiple images by simply copy-pasting, dragging and dropping, or using the image picker. It’s quick, seamless, and flexible.

The best part? The quality of your images is preserved, so your visuals stay sharp. You can also resize images to fit your content perfectly, giving you more control over how your notes look.

Want to get creative? You can nest images within other content, letting you express your ideas in a way that’s clear and visually engaging.

Give it a try and let your notes come to life with images!
